Facilitate teachers daily work including creating marks and lesson drafts, curricula and calculating marks for written tests etc.

This software is an approach to facilitate teachers daily work including creating marks and lesson drafts, curricula and calculating marks for written tests etc.
It is especially designed for the german (berlin) high school and only localized for german users. 
It uses the EntityFramework5 with an SQL Database and WPF with LINQ with heavy use of the MVVM.
Hope someone finds it useful, donÂ´t hesitat to ask.
